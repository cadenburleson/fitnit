## In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Debugging environment variable loading
- ðŸ”„ Stabilizing pose detection
- ðŸ”„ Fine-tuning exercise detection accuracy

## Known Issues
1. Environment variable loading inconsistencies
2. Occasional WebGL initialization errors
3. Camera flip/mirroring needs verification
4. Pose detection stability needs improvement

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Resolve environment variable loading issues
2. Improve pose detection stability
3. Implement proper error handling for WebGL and camera initialization
4. Add loading states and user feedback during initialization

### Medium Priority
1. Enhance exercise detection accuracy
2. Add exercise form validation
3. Implement user progress tracking
4. Add exercise history storage in Supabase

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more exercises to the tracking system
2. Implement custom exercise creation
3. Add workout routines/programs
4. Implement social features (sharing, comparing)
5. Add visual feedback for exercise form
6. Implement progressive web app capabilities

## Technical Debt
1. Add proper error boundaries
2. Implement comprehensive logging
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Optimize performance for mobile devices
5. Implement proper TypeScript types

## Documentation Needed
1. Setup instructions for new developers
2. API documentation
3. Exercise detection algorithm documentation
4. User guide
5. Contribution guidelines
